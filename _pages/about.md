I am a 2nd year M.S. student in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill advised by [Prof. Andrew Kwong](https://andrewkwong.org/). My research interests lies computer architecture and security with a focus on microarchitectural side-channel attacks and defenses. 

Before coming to the United States, I completed my secondary education in Taiwan and graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2020 with a Bachelor's in Applied Science (B.ASc.) majoring in Computer Engineering. 

My recent projects explore techniques to extract sufficiently accurate keystroke timing using cache side-channel attacks for reconstruction on Intel and Apple processors. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and exploring other microarchitectural vulnerabilities.
